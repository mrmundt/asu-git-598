# Module 1

## Overview

Module 1 defines accessibility, principles driving accessibility and user experience, and explains the importance of accessibility in cross-media design products.

## Objectives

- Identify key types of disabilities that can impact media consumption and interaction.
- Review industry-standard UX design principles.
- Discuss industry-standard accessibility principles.
- Summarize the importance of accessibility in cross-media design in promoting inclusivity and preventing discrimination.
- Differentiate between accessible and inaccessible media.

## Lectures

### Introduction to Accessibility

- Accessibility: the concept of whether a product or service can be used by everyone - however they encounter it
- Disability Types
  - Visual - blindness; low vision; color vision deficiency
  - Auditory - deafness; hard of hearing; deaf-blindness
  - Cognitive - mental health; learning conditions; autism spectrum disorder; ADHD/ADD; memory loss; vestibular disorders (seizures, vertigo)
  - Physical - muscular limitations; paralysis; rheumatism; amputation; tremors/spasms
  - Speech - weakness/paralysis of muscles for speech; stuttering; muteness; speech sound disorder
- Accessible vs. inclusive design
  - Accessible: remove barriers for people with disabilities; part of inclusive design
  - Inclusive: design methodologies to remove barriers for all; build products for full range of human diversity
- Key milestones of disability rights
  - 1973: Rehabilitation Act
  - 1990: Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
  - 1998: Section 508 - equality within technology use
  - 2024: Title II (ADA) updated - extends requirements to public entities

### User Experience (UX) and Accessibility Principles

- UX encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products
- UX testing - assess user experience
- UX Principles - Peter Morville's UX Honeycomb
  - Seven attributes: useful, usable, findable, valuable, credible, accessible, desirable
  - Useful: of value to users; fills users' needs; allows users to accomplish goals
  - Usable: easy to use; easy to understand
  - Findable: easy to navigate; easy for users to find information
  - Credible: trustworthy; consistent; matching brand
  - Valuable: (uniquely) valuable to users; valuable to stakeholders
  - Desirable: visually appealing; offers what users need; stands out over other products
  - Accessible: available to as many users as possible; usable to as many users as possible
- POUR
  - Perceivable: information/interface presented so users can perceive
  - Operable: components such as nav/buttons are operable
  - Understandable: information/interface are understandable to users
  - Robust: content is robust enough for assistive technology to interpret
- Inclusive Design Principles
  - Recognize exclusion
  - Learn from human diversity
  - Solve for one, extend to many

### Accessibility in Design

- Common cross-media accessibility concerns
  - Color/color contrast - goal is color harmony (e.g., high-contrast; want 4.5:1 ratio or higher)
  - Text alternatives - provide descriptive test for images and other non-text media
  - Typography - typeface, font family, readability/legibility
  - Logical structure/layout - navigation, keyboard accessibility, visual consistency
