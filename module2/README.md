## Lectures

### Laws Governing Accessibility

- Laws: required and enforceable
  - Passed by legislative bodies
  - Businesses/orgs must comply or face fines/sanctions
  - ADA is a user right
- Regulations: required and enforceable; can also be called rules
  - Developed by govt agencies to implement laws
  - Businesses/orgs must comply or face fines/sanctions
  - ADA is a user right
- Guideline: not required, not enforceable, but good practice; also known as standards
- Accessibility-related laws/regulations
  - Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) - with Title II and III
    - July 1990
	- Prohibits disability discrimination and requires reasonable accommodations
	- Extends protections to millions; reduces barriers; fosters greater awareness
	- Title II
	  - 1991, with revisions through 2024
	  - Prohibits discriminations in state and local govt; includes digital govt services
	- Title III
	  - 1991, with revisions through 2010
	  - Prohibits discrimination in public accommodation and commercial facilities; extends to include businesses and NPOs
  - Rehabilitation Act of 1973 - Sections 504 and 508
    - Section 504: prohibits discrimination from any federally funded entity (including educational institutions)
	- Section 508: fed agencies must make electronic and information tech systems accessible; aligns with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
  - Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA)
    - 2010; update to Comms Act of 1934
	- Includes "modern" communications tech
	- Comms within advanced tech devices must be accessible (e.g., video games must have CC)

### Accessibility Guidelines

- Color and Text Alternatives
  - Color-contrast (should be 4.5:1 or higher in body text; 3:1 or higher in headings; 21:1 is the highest)
  - Avoid color alone for emphasis
  - Avoid using too many colors and be careful with patterns
  - Patterns can be beneficial in some situations, e.g., pie charts
  - Photos
    - If text overlays a photo, check contrast at different sizes
  - Alt text
    - Provide meaningful alt text for images (descriptive text/captions/context)
	- Include long descriptions for complex images
	- Decorative images do NOT need alt text
  - Auto-transcription: check for accuracy because it's often wrong
- Typography and Logical Structure
  - Keep consistent typography hierarchy (levels of headings)
  - Readability/legibility
    - Use legible text size and readable font families
	- Avoid display or script typefaces for body text
	- Use sufficient leading and spacing (e.g., kerning); leading of 1.5+ is ideal
	- Be aware of text alignment (western culture prefers left-aligned); justified is the worst version
  - Content hierarchy
    - Larger images are intended to draw attention
  - Keyboard access == ensuring product is accessible through keyboard only
  - Identify and remove keyboard traps: links in documents, pop-ups, widgets, form fields
  - Reduce clutter: negative space is a good thing, avoid sensory overload
- Plain Language
  - Plain Writing Act of 2010 says that fed govt agencies have to write their documents issued to the public clearly and in plain language
  - Writing that is clear, concise, well-organized, with non-complex sentences / jargon
  - Semantics
    - Use simple, common words
	- Use active voice
	- Avoid double negatives
	- Avoid (or explain) abbreviations and acronyms
  - Limit sentence and paragraph sizes
