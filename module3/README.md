# Module 3

## Overview

Module 3 explores the tools and techniques available to assess the accessibility of cross-media products.

## Objectives

- Explore techniques used in industry for assessment.
- Explore industry-standard assessment tools.
- Investigate available assistive technologies.
- Collaborate with classmates on assessment of instructor-provided product.
- Generate ideas for a plan for a higher-level audit.

## Lectures

### Introduction to Accessibility Assessments

- Assessments: focus on identifying specific issues; quick review; does design meet guidelines? Usually performed prior to user testing
- Audits: more formal than assessments; does design meet standards and laws? Usually performed prior to product launch; normally only one or two done
- Why conduct an assessment?
  - Time - it's faster
  - Quick check of design against guidelines/principles
  - Find "low-hanging fruit"
  - Use assessment to plan formal audit
- How do I conduct one?
  - Choose product
  - Choose guidelines
  - Rate elements
  - Provide examples for non-adherence
  - Report findings
  - Present recommendations
- Principles/guidelines serve as a benchmark against which accessibility is measured

### Assessment Methods and Tools

- Assistive technologies: software or hardware to improve interaction (e.g., screen readers, screen magnifiers, speech recognition, selection switches)
- Adaptive stategies: techniques to improve interaction (e.g., increase text size, turning on captions)
- Evaluation of accessibility tools
  - Manual inspection - relies on combination of guidelines and technologies
    - Humans look at the product (e.g., against laws and guidelines)
  - Automated tools - scans products and identifies barriers based on pre-defined rules
    - Scanning tools; will find errors and return results (comprehensive or specific)
  - Testing with actual users

  - Communication: Articulating needs, goals, intentions, and feedback in conversations and products
- Three Guiding principles
  - balancing your bias

  - embracing a growth mindset
- Example of research plan - pick and choose what works for you and your products needs
	- Research plan purpose: What is the purpose of the research? What goals are you trying to achieve?
	- Context of use of the product:	Is this an existing product in which the uses are known? Is this a new product? When and where will people be using the product?
	- Priority areas of research: Based on your goals, what are the priority areas for your research?
	- Methodologies:	What methodologies will you use for your research? Personas? Interviews? Surveys? Usability Testing? Others?
	- Premortem (what could go wrong): Make a list of all the things that could go wrong during research and make a plan to mitigate those risks
	- Timeframe: How much time do you have for research and synthesis?
	- Research questions: What type of questions could you ask that will help you reach the goal of your research?
	- Goals: What is the primary goal of the research? How does this align with business goals?
	- Participants: Who will your participants be? How will you include people with disabilities? How will you recruit participants?
	- Script?: If the users are testing a product with a goal in mind, what type of script will you use?
	- Ethics: What are the ethical values of your organization?
