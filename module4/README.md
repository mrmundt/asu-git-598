# Module 4

## Overview

Module 4 focuses on guidelines specific to cross-media design, and how to assess media for accessibility issues.


## Objectives

- Review techniques for assessing accessibility in media.
- Review guidelines specific to cross-media products (web, print, video)
- Utilize appropriate techniques/tools to assess print or digital media for compliance with laws and guidelines.
- Write an explanation of chosen techniques/tools and why, and the key results of assessment and annotated screenshots.
- Deliver peer reviews of classmatesâ€™ assessments screenshots.

## Lectures

### Designing Accessibility Media Part 1

- Accessible Web Design
  - Semantic HTML - screen readers like properly labelled HTML code
  - Responsive design - adaptive to different screen sizes / technologies
  - "Skip to content" navigation - allow users to bypass competitive navigation
  - Accessibility of widgets and overlays
- Accessible PDF design
  - PDF tagging and structure
  - Table accessibility (e.g., table headers, not weird merging)
  - Avoid images of text - use real text (or at least descriptive alt text)
- Accessible video design
  - Avoid flashing content
  - Audio descriptions (especially where visuals are crucial for understanding)
- Consistent design across media
  - Company == brand == consistency
    - Seamless user experience - reduces confusion/frustration; good experience == reliable
	- Brand trust and recognition - familiar messaging; fosters trust
	- Clear communication - consistent messaging; consistent terminology
	- Cohesive storytelling - maintaining a clear narrative; platforms compliment each other
	- Increased accessibility - predictable layouts/interfaces; improves experience for everyone

### Designing Accessibility Media Part 2 - POUR and WCAG

- Perceivable
  - Content presented so users can perceive with available sense
  - Sense-agnostic content
  - Major areas covered: text alternatives; captions; content presented in multiple different ways
- Operable
  - Interface, interactive elements operable with technologies
  - Major areas include: keyboard-only access; timed-content available long enough for users to use; flashing/strobing content alternatives; persistent, helpful navigation
- Understandable
  - Interface and content are understable to users, behave how users expect
  - Major areas include: readable, understandable text; content shown in predictable, adaptable ways; assistance for users to avoid errors
- Robust
  - Content and interface robust enough for compatibility with technology
  - Major areas covered: compatible with current and future technologies; keep up with current standards to future-proof content
- WCAG
  - Internationally recognized standards
  - Developed through W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)
  - Mainly for web BUT... video, pdfs, slide decks, spreadsheets, etc. all fall under it
  - Guidelines - 13 total, organized by POUR
    - 1.x: Perceivable
	- 2.x: Operable
	- 3.x: Understandable
	- 4.x: Robust

### Designing Accessibility Media Part 3 - Assignment 5 Information

(I'm not going to take notes on this because it's specific to the assignment.)

### Sketching and Prototyping Designs

- Why prototype? Solve design problems; brainstorm layouts; explore info arch; establish functionality; communicate ideas
- Types of protoypes
  - Low-fidelity (sketching/storyboarding)
    - hand-drawn, rough sketches
	- digital wireframes, no interaction
  - Medium-fidelity
    - digital wireframes, limited interaction
  - High-fidelity (very refined)
    - working/functioning pages
	- more polished, more interaction
